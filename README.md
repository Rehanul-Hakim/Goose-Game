# Goose Game
## Description
A game where you have to escape a goose chasing you in a field in the University of Waterloo campus. Once you reach a fixed endpoint, you will win the game. Once you lose all your lives, you will lose the game.
## Features
- Walls are there to provide an obstacle for you, but allow the goose to jump over them.
- Powerups are on the field to give you an edge in the game such as:
  - Freeze packs which stop the goose from moving for a certain number of turns
  - Health packs that give an extra amount of life
  - Teleporters which teleport you to a random space in the area in case you are close to the goos
